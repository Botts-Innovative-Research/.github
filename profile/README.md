# Welcome to Botts Innovative Research
Botts Innovative Research, Inc (Botts-Inc) specializes in the design and application of open standards and open source software for sensor systems within the national security, public sector, private sector, and scientific communities. Botts-Inc has been heavily involved in the design, development, and implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) architecture, and the emerging OGC API – Connected Systems specification, discovering and tasking of sensors, publishing and subscribing to alerts, and streaming, parsing, processing, and portrayal of real-time and archived observations. Botts-Inc has extensive experience in processing and fusing a wide range of sensors, from those on satellite and airborne platforms, to those on mobile and static ground-based stations.

Botts-Inc provides extensive subject matter expertise in the application of SensorML, OGC SWE services, and OGC API – Connected Systems, as well as in the processing and precise geolocation of remotely sensed observations from satellite, airborne, ocean, or ground-based platforms. We also have extensive experience in designing and developing highly interactive, dynamic, 4D visualization environments for the fusion of observations and other geospatial data from disparate sources.

Botts-Inc is available to provide R&D services, architecture and standards leadership, and implementation expertise to help you grapple with your priority mission/business challenges with respect to the interoperable integration of you sensors, things, robots, drones, satellites, control systems, devices and platform – whether in space, air, land, sea, and cyber.
